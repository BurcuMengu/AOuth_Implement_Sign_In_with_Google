AOuth_Implement_Sign_In_with_Google Description

This project is an OAuth 2.0 implementation that allows users to sign in using their Google accounts. 
Through Google's authentication system, users can securely log in, and the project contains the necessary OAuth client credentials to manage this process.
It provides a basic framework for interacting with Google APIs to retrieve user information and perform authentication.
This enables third-party applications to securely access user data and integrate with Google services.
